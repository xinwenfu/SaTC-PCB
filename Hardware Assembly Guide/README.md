## Assembly guide for SIC2_EDU security IoT kit Printed Circuit Board.

This is a guide on the assembly and soldering of the SatC_EDU IoT kit PCB.

The very first component that should be placed and soldered is the micro-USB connector that allows the board to be connected to a PC for programming and power. 

These connectors have two protrusions on the bottom that fit into the two board cut outs on the USB footprint outline. This makes lining up the small data and power lines very easy. 
 
Add a little bit of flux to the board where the connector will go. Once the connector is placed, turn the board over and sill in the holes that the USB prongs stick through. Fill these holes with solder, this will assure the USB connector does not break off or move around. 

Once in the place the five small pins will sit alligned with the solder pads underneith them. These connections should be soldered with a fine tip, one by one, combing is NOT advised.
